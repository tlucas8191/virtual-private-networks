<h1>VPN Setup and Usage (using Proton VPN) (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation and usage of a virtual private network (specifically Proton VPN) within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to implement a virtual private network on a virtual machine within Azure Compute](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Proton VPN

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Virtual Private Network Lab Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ and take note of the IP Address.
- Step 2: Create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine inside of Azure, login and browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ again and take note of the IP Address.
- Step 3: On the actual computer, sign up for the free version of Proton VPN.
- Step 4: Back within the VM, download Proton VPN client, login to the VPN and choose a VPN server in another country, browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ again and take note of 
  the IP Address.
- Step 5: Try browsing to Google, Disney, and/or Amazon (or any website) and see if there is anything different about the sites in relation to the location of the VPN server. For 
  example, the language or URL may be different.

</p>
<p>
In this step, we created a Windows 10 Virtual Machine inside of Azure, logged in and browsed to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ again and take note of the IP Address.  It showed a different IP Address than the first IP Address from step 1.
